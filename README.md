# About

This is an alternative firmware to the
*Waveshare ESP32-S3-PhotoPainter 7.3inch E6 Full Color E-paper Display*.

[Link][1].

The [original firmware][2]
is written in C++ and includes lot of stuff, like Audio speech-to-text, AI image generation and display weather information.

My goal is to write a very basic firmware instead,
written in Rust, but with the feature to send new images over Bluetooth BLE.

It is also a learning project for me to get to know the ESP32 better.
